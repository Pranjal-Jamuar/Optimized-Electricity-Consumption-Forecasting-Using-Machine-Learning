# Optimized-Electricity-Consumption-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning
Project for Applied Machine Learning

Efficient management and planning the use of the energy (electricity), accurate forecasting of electricity consumption is critical. Predictive modeling has emerged as a useful tool to carry out such forecasting tasks with the increasing availability of data and improvement in the machine learning (ML) technique. In this study we study the performance of multiple regression-based ML models on an electricity consumption dataset to find the best one. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost are evaluated as models. There is preprocessing of the dataset, for example feature scaling to get the most optimized model performance. This is evaluated in terms of model effectiveness using evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score. Results show that XGBoost achieves the best performance across all metrics compared to the advanced ensemble methods, while traditional linear models are outperformed by advanced ensemble methods. Further improvement in forecasting accuracy will become possible in future work, for instance via hyperparameter optimization and deep learning-based approaches.
